    <h1 ><u>WHAT COMFORT DO YOU GET?</u></h1>
    <h3 class="one">
    <p>
        I have written many,<br>
        But this is not just like any,<br>
        I have a questiuon in mind,<br>
        And the answer am yet to find,<br>
        What comfort do you get?<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        I sometimes become confused,<br>
        When i see you being difussed,<br>
        Into young flowers with innocense,<br>
        But all to me i term nonsense.<br>
        What comfort do you get?<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        One day i was quiet and idle,<br>
        Next to me was a paper with a riddle,<br>
        I managed to read its contents,<br>
        But all were just rodents.<br>
        What comfort do you get? 
    </p>
    <p>
        Your discussion have lots of romantics,<br>
        You move from place to place like nomadic,<br>
        Trying atleast to talk to someone special,<br>
        Whom you have seen in a specific ratio.<br>
        What comfort do you get?
    </p>
    <p>
       Ask them of the comfort they get,<br>
       They will tell you of the words they expect,<br>
       And a slightly warm comfort zone,<br>
       Where they can live all alone.<br>
       What comfort do you get?

    <h1><i>WHAT IS LOVE?</i></h1>
    <h3 class="two">
    <p>
        Though I am young<br>
        And i know little about<br>
        About the combination of<br>
        Of letters L-O-V-E<br>
        I think I have an hint about it<br>
        Yes I have a rumour about it
    </p>
    <p>
        They say it is an affection<br>
        A burning fire beyond control<br>
        They say it is jealosy<br>
        Or it is not deaf but blind<br>
        But whichever they way they describe it;<br>
        I have my fashion of its description.
    </p>
    <p>
        Love is not the youthful curiosity<br>
        It is not all about the bed<br>
        Or about the rings the wear<br>
        No!No!No! I disagree at all<br>
        It is far much beyond that.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is not all about wealth.<br> 
        Nor about the number of kids.<br>
        Nor the beauty or handsomeness.<br>
        Nor the names they use.<br>
        No!No!No! I disagree at all<br>

    </p>
    <p>
        Love is the relationship<br>
        The oneness in two;<br>
        The capability to solve isssues together<br>
        The ease to forgive one another<br>
        The pride to share bitterness<br>
        And the patience to endure fortunes together.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is all about the affection<br>
        That you have for one another<br>
        The unselfishness to care for the other<br>
        Or the tendency to forget oneself for the other<br>
        Or forgetting your name to remember the other<br>
        The willingnes to loss the other to get
    </p>
    <p>
        Deeper more into it i have this;<br>
        It is the acceptance of ones failures<br>
        The grateful appreciation for ones failures<br>
        The sight of goodness in faults<br>
        And the feel of pleasure when it bores<br>
        It is the sweetness in tasteless meals<br>
        And the beauty in ugly complextions<br>
        Yes, all because of the word LOVE.
    </p>
    <p>
        But because I am poor in words<br>
        May i not give further descriptions<br>
        Because this forest is wild;<br>
        and am not so much familiar with it<br>
        But the fact shall still stand its grounds<br>
        That is deeper dimesions about it.
    </p>
